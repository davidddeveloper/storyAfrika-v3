            <p class="text-[30px] text-extra-lightgray mt-[20px]">This fascinating story allowed me to vividly imagine his experiences, and I wanted others to hear it as well. Thus, the idea of creating a platform dedicated to sharing the stories and everyday experiences of people like Balla was born.</p>
